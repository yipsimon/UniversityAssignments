Fictional Auction Site

This was a Team Project to create Fictional Auction Site to simulate the buying and bidding aspect of auction. 
The website allows the user to search for items and allows severals conditions attached to the search. 
This is also a function for the user to log in written in the code and would be uploaded to a server. 

While it is possible to download and display the website with a server but it cannot get any data for the website as this project was done 
with a university provided server and database. 

It is necessary to change the database link from the code in order for the website to function.
This project was assessed by Loughborough University and received high marks overall.
