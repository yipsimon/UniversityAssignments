COP505 Internet Systems Assignement

Start up instruction
Project must be run on the university computers in the Linux or OSX partition.
Open a shell (command line) terminal.
Install “pymongo” and “requests” onto the system using the following terminal commands:

	pip2 install requests --user
	pip2 install pymongo –-user

Now unzip the files and put them under the Home (~) directory.
Open the files basestation.py and monitor.py and edit this line

url = "http://cosyly@sci-project.lboro.ac.uk”

Replace 'cosyly' with your own username for the sci-project. 
(This line can be found in line 62, 94 of basestation.py and line 6 of monitor.py)

Open dataprocess.py file, edit these lines

client = MongoClient("mongodb://cosyly:4JbHBLrBqK@sci-project:27017/cosyly")
db = client.cosyly

Replace the 'cosyly' and '4JbHBLrBqk' with your own username and password for the mongo database.
These lines are at line 10 and 11


Next, open a new terminal to connect to the sci-project server. To do this, enter 
	
	ssh <username>@sci-project.lboro.ac.uk

follow the instructions to connect to the server

On your local terminal, enter the following command

	scp dataprocess.py <username>@<username>.sci-project.lboro.ac.uk:dataprocess.py

This should upload the dataprocess.py to the server. You can check this by using the ‘ls’ command in the server terminal.

Now, when running dataprocess.py on the sci-project server, you must do so by running the following commands in the server terminal:

	export FLASK_APP=dataprocess.py
	flask run –-host=0.0.0.0 –-port=5001

When running the base station, and network monitoring files, the user must compile using the command ‘python2’ rather than simply ‘python’ on a local terminal i.e:

	python2 basestation.py
	python2 monitor.py


Base Station main thread controls

After you have started the base station and it is generating mobile connection.
Commands: 'start' or 'pause' will start/pause generating mobile connection in the base station.
Command: 'stop' will terminate the base station and disconnect all current connection to the base station and remove all records including hte base station in the database.
